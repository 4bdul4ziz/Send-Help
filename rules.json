If you miss an attack in CWL without sufficient justification, you will be warned/retired. At CO's discretion, you may be allowed to stay but will sit the rest of CWL.\n:arrow: **Base Calling:** We use the in-game calling function to call up bases during CWL.\n:arrow: **Performance:** Participation through the week is based on consistency and performance. Weak performances are subbed out for the week in the event more subs are available. Zero or 1 star attacks will sit the next day unless there are no available rotations.\n:arrow: **Bonuses:** Bonuses are awarded based on the overall contribution of the player- filling war castles, war performances, strategy plannings at the war room and so forth. \n:arrow: **Absences:** Planned absences should be communicated in advance of CWL to plan accordingly. In case of emergencies, please let us know and we will adjust the lineup.",

    "description": "Failure to follow the mentioned rules will lead to warnings and sanctions; and potential removal from the clan.\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ **1st Offence - Informal Warning**\nFor a first offence, we will reach out to confirm what happened. We understand you may not have known the rules. For a missed attack, perhaps a serious personal circumstance occurred. We will remind you of the rules and advise a formal warning will be issued next time.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ **2nd Offence - Formal Warning**\nIf you repeat an offence, but you have never had an official warning, we will issue a formal warning with the `!locker` command for traceability on your server profile.\n\nüîÅ **Repeat Offence - Given Grace**\nIf this is a repeat offence but it hasn't happened in a long time or there is reasonable justification, the leadership team may agree to give you grace.\n\n‚ùå **Repeat Offence - Removal**\nIf this is a repeat offence within a short timeframe, or there are multiple other warnings for you, the leadership team may decide to remove you. You will be kicked from the clan(s) and server, and you will receive a Discord DM explaining why you have been kicked.\n\nüö® **Rules are Tougher during CWL**\nGiven the importance of CWL, our tolerance is lower for any form of infraction. The leadership team may choose to take stricter action at any time, including immediate removal.\n",
