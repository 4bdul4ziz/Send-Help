Below outline the rules and exceptions for the capital contributions.\n\n**Capital Upgrades**\n:arrow: **Upgrade Strategy:** Follow the upgrade strategy as posted in the upgrade checklists & ask COs for help and/or exceptions.\n\n**Capital Raids**\n:arrow: **Strategy:** Follow the raid strategy as posted & ask COs for help and/or exceptions.\n:arrow: **Attack Order:** There is no specific attack order. Simply attack throughout the weekend when you are available.\n:arrow: **Bonus Attacks**: At the current level, districts require fewer than 5 attacks to be 3-starred enabling everyone to get a bonus attack. However, if districts start requiring more than 5 attacks in the future, please assist your clan-mates in obtaining a bonus attack by checking in-game and on discord if anyone needs a bonus attack.\n\n**General Contribution Agenda**\n:arrow: **Donations:** Minis or any other accounts that aren't in the clan may be temporarily brought into the clan for contributing capital gold. Ensure our upgrade priorities are followed.\n:arrow: **Raids:** Minis or any other accounts that aren't in the clan may be temporarily brought into the clan for participating in our capital raids. Ensure our capital raid strategies are followed.\n:arrow: **Removal:** Minis or any other accounts that aren't in the clan; must be immediately removed following donations or raids. Spaces cannot be held for those accounts. The clans are deemed \"maxed\" at 49 accounts to allow for bringing in minis. If players are found to not remove their temporary accounts in a timely fashion, they will receive a warning.",

If upgrading, opt out of war.\n:arrow: **Pet Upgrades:** Pet upgrades allowed during war. No need to opt out except during CWL.\n:arrow: **Attacks:** Both attacks must be used in war. If no viable stars or destruction percentage can be gained, you may practice an attack on an already attacked base to ensure the attack is used.\n:arrow: **Attack Timing:** All attacks must be completed PRIOR to the final 30 minutes of war unless approved by a CO.\n:arrow: **No Babysitting:** Our bot pings war reminders as follows: 8 hrs, 4 hrs, 6 hrs & 1 hr remaining. It is the accountability of player to get their hits in.\n:arrow: **War Requirement:** You may opt out to upgrade heroes for the majority of the season. All players need to be in war for at least 3 or 4 (depending on the TH level) wars per season/month.\n:arrow: **Maxed Minis:** Required to war a minimum of once a week all season and participate in CWL.\n\n📍**Base Claiming**\n:arrow: **Preparation Day:** Do not claim on preparation day.\n:arrow: **How To:** Visit <#769244397123665960> for more info on working with the wm-bot\n:arrow: **Invalid:** Claims last for 2 hours, beyond which they're invalid.\n:arrow: **CWL:** Claims during CWL do not require wmbot and are done in-game. \n:arrow: **Fairness:** Claim one base at a time.\n\n⏰ **War Cycles**\n:arrow: **Pirates:** B2B **<OR>** same as Parallax & Royals.\n:arrow: **Parallax:** Monday/Wednesday/Friday at 6pm UTC\n:arrow: **Royal Pirates:** Monday/Wednesday/Friday at 6pm UTC\n:arrow: **Rogue Pirates:** Depends on the FWA cycle.\n\n",

Here at Reddit Pirates, CWL is a celebrated week full of intense wars.\n\n:arrow: **Sign Ups:** Sign up form will be posted during clan games, make sure to sign yourself up to participate.\n:arrow: **War Strategy:** Strategies will be posted in the event of mismatches which is bound to happen- these are taken into consideration of all factors affecting our victory on that day. Follow the war strategy as communicated. If unclear, please ask a CO in-game or on Discord.\n:arrow: **Attacks:** Attacks must be used in CWL. If you miss an attack in CWL without sufficient justification, you will be warned/retired. At CO's discretion, you may be allowed to stay but will sit the rest of CWL.\n:arrow: **Base Calling:** We use the in-game calling function to call up bases during CWL.\n:arrow: **Performance:** Participation through the week is based on consistency and performance. Weak performances are subbed out for the week in the event more subs are available. Zero or 1 star attacks will sit the next day unless there are no available rotations.\n:arrow: **Bonuses:** Bonuses are awarded based on the overall contribution of the player- filling war castles, war performances, strategy plannings at the war room and so forth. \n:arrow: **Absences:** Planned absences should be communicated in advance of CWL to plan accordingly. In case of emergencies, please let us know and we will adjust the lineup.",

We understand you may not have known the rules. For a missed attack, perhaps a serious personal circumstance occurred. We will remind you of the rules and advise a formal warning will be issued next time.\n\n2️⃣ **2nd Offence - Formal Warning**\nIf you repeat an offence, but you have never had an official warning, we will issue a formal warning with the `!locker` command for traceability on your server profile.\n\n🔁 **Repeat Offence - Given Grace**\nIf this is a repeat offence but it hasn't happened in a long time or there is reasonable justification, the leadership team may agree to give you grace.\n\n❌ **Repeat Offence - Removal**\nIf this is a repeat offence within a short timeframe, or there are multiple other warnings for you, the leadership team may decide to remove you. You will be kicked from the clan(s) and server, and you will receive a Discord DM explaining why you have been kicked.\n\n🚨 **Rules are Tougher during CWL**\nGiven the importance of CWL, our tolerance is lower for any form of infraction. The leadership team may choose to take stricter action at any time, including immediate removal.\n",
