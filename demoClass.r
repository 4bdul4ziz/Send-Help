# Write R code to perform arithmetic operation, relational operation, logical operation and assignment operation using R.

# Arithmetic operation
# Addition
1 + 1
# Subtraction
1 - 1
# Multiplication
1 * 1
# Division
1 / 1
# Modulus
1 % 1
# Exponent
1**1
# Floor division
1 // 1
# Floor division with remainder
1 %/% 1

# Relational operation
# Equal to
1 == 1
# Not equal to
1 != 1
# Less than
1 < 1
# Less than or equal to
1 <= 1
# Greater than
1 > 1
# Greater than or equal to
1 >= 1

# Logical operation
# Logical AND
1 & 1
# Logical OR
1 | 1
# Logical NOT
!1
# Logical XOR
1^1

# Assignment operation
# Assignment
a = 1
# Addition assignment
a += 1
# Subtraction assignment
a -= 1
# Multiplication assignment
a *= 1
# Division assignment
a /= 1
# Modulus assignment
a %= 1
# Exponent assignment
a **= 1
# Floor division assignment
a //= 1
# Floor division with remainder assignment
a %/%= 1
